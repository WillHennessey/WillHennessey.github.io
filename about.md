  Hey there! I'm based in Dublin/Ireland and am currently working as a Site Reliability Engineer for Groupon.
</p>

Previously I worked as a Senior Software Engineer for Symantec and spent the majority of my time building web applications and automating business processes.

## So why the Blog?

I started this blog 4 years ago just to share any fun or challenging work I do.

I love to code and am always dabbling with emerging technologies, frameworks and languages.

Have questions, suggestions or feedback? 
Feel free to leave a comment on one of my posts or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/sicklickwill).

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the posts!
