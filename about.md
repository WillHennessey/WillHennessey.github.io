<p class="message">
  Hey there! I'm Will Hennessey, I'm based in Dublin/Ireland and work as a software engineer for a Cyber Security company.
</p>
My day to day job involves, building in-house systems, automating business processes and building web-applications.
I'm most at home when working on the back end, but I'm no stranger to frontend design either.

Ruby and Ruby on Rails are my fort√©. I aspire to one day be that Object Orientation guru who can spot patterns anywhere and apply elegant designs to solve any of life's most mind boggling problems.

I'm really interested in web application security and pentesting, although it's not part of my day job, I like poking around with tools like Burpsuite and OWASP ZAP

## So why the Blog?

My main reason for starting this blog is to share any fun or challenging work I do.

Ruby has an amazing online community and I have learned tonnes of valuable lessons from reading blogs and posts of those who tried (and sometimes failed) before me.

It feels almost rude not to try give something back that could be of benefit to other web developers, software engineers, students (it's all the same really).
