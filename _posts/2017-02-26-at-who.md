<p class='message'>@RailsDeveloper Want to implement your own version of twitter's mention feature in your Rails app?<p>
 
In this post I'll show you how to implement the mention feature for comments, but don't feel limited to just comments. You can easily adapt the code to work on posts, articles, tickets or whatever you like. 
## Installation
First things first, we'll need to install and configure the [jquery-atwho-rails](https://github.com/ichord/jquery-atwho-rails) gem.

Add `gem 'jquery-atwho-rails'` to your Gemfile then do a `bundle install`

<div class='block-code'>
{% highlight js %}
//= require jquery
//= require jquery.atwho
{% endhighlight %}
then add this to app/assets/javascripts/application.js
</div>

<div class='block-code'>
{% highlight css%}
//=require jquery.atwho 
{% endhighlight %}
and this to app/assets/stylesheets/applications.css
</div>
